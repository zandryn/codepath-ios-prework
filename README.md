An idea I have for an app would be a show and movie tracker similar to Letterboxd. However, it will track episodes, you can tag friends, and gather reccomendations based off of previous and proximity history. It would also work with a lot of film festivals where people attend film festivals, small or large. All the movies in that festival will be grouped and made more interactive. 

## Notes

The simulators to run the build were inaccurate and I had to adjust it to iPhone 16 Pro.
